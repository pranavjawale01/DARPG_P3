## Problem Statement
Evaluate and optimize an existing open-source speech-to-text transcription tool for accurately converting feedback calls related to citizen grievances into English text. The goal is to benchmark the toolâ€™s performance and implement enhancements to achieve measurable improvements in transcription accuracy for calls in Hindi, English, and Hinglish. This project does not involve creating a new system but rather focuses on refining an already established open-source solution.
